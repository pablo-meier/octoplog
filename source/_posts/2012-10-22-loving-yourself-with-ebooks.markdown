While I'm still ramping up at the [new gig][1], I've found a love of code again
and recently launched new side project. I may still work on it yet, but chances
are I'll leave it be for a bit while I pursue other interests (hey, it works
well as is and I'm not shipping it :-p).

It's called **Ebooker**, and if you'd like to have a look at the source, fire me
an email, I have it hosted on a private repo on [Bitbucket][2]

### Ebooker?

Ebooker takes it's name from [@horse\_ebooks][3], one of the most famous Twitter
accounts that (legend has it) was a spam bot that forgot to sell it's wares,
only remembering to try to sound human to avoid spam detection. As a result, you
get a sort of [abstract poetry][4]:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Thigh exercises so strongly targeted, they ll leave you crawling on floor, waving</p>&mdash; Horse ebooks (@Horse\_ebooks) <a href="https://twitter.com/Horse_ebooks/status/193422537953263616" data-datetime="2012-04-20T19:35:01+00:00">April 20, 2012</a></blockquote>

As a result, it's a bit customary to include the phrase "ebooks" in Twitter
bots, even if they aren't trying to sell anything as @horse\_ebooks was. Some
examples are:

* [@bogost\_ebooks][5], a bot imitating the game designer Ian Bogost.
* [@kpich\_ebooks][6], a bot imitating the esteemed [Karl Pichotta][7].
* [@RandomTedTalks][8], imitating the titles of TED Talks.

Given this, *Ebooker takes as input any number of Twitter streams, and will
create a bot that will imitate their union.* The most obvious (and narcissistic)
example is the new [@SrPablo\_ebooks][9], based on [my Twitter stream][10]:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>I thought this was hell, but I'm afraid folk looking over my shoulder will think it's cool technology).</p>&mdash; olbaP reieM (@SrPablo\_ebooks) <a href="https://twitter.com/SrPablo_ebooks/status/256804761918111744" data-datetime="2012-10-12T17:13:21+00:00">October 12, 2012</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Graduated. Now goin' back to Providence.

But it gets more fun when you combine accounts. I enabled [@SrLaurelita][11], a
combination of my and my girlfriend [@laurelita][12]'s tweets:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Note to self: don't forget the Flash Player security fix we just released! CONTAIN YOUR EXCITEMENT!!!</p>&mdash; Laurblo Jeierson (@SrLaurelita) <a href="https://twitter.com/SrLaurelita/status/259764265152548865" data-datetime="2012-10-20T21:13:21+00:00">October 20, 2012</a></blockquote>
<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Also, best addition to my gut and learned the names of the guys here are gay, or just damn stylish. Either way, let me tell you MY opinion</p>&mdash; Laurblo Jeierson (@SrLaurelita) <a href="https://twitter.com/SrLaurelita/status/258495907677483009" data-datetime="2012-10-17T09:13:21+00:00">October 17, 2012</a></blockquote>

The nice thing about Ebooker is that it does the tweeting for you: I tell it who
I want to mix and match, how often I want it to tweet, and it does the rest.
